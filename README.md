# agda-proof-trees

Proof trees are nice to look at some times. ðŸ™ƒ
This library lets you write proof trees and their rules nearly word for word in Agda. 

To get an idea of the syntax see a short and medium [example here](examples/Examples.lagda.md)

## Some gotchas
### Syntax
- Colons are unicode colons ```êž‰``` written as ```\:4```
- Commas in Contexts have a dot under them ```,Ì£``` written as ```,\_.```
- Lambdas also use dots underneath ```Î»Ì£``` written similarly as ```\Gl\_.```
- Sigma pairs are written with lowercase sigma ```Ïƒ a , b```
- Bars ```^â”€â”€â”€â”€``` and ```â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€``` are using the char ```â”€``` written as ```\---```
- The bar you choose in a proof tree affects syntax for their dependencies.
  - Use ```â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€``` when wanting to write its dependencies as a list expression.
  - Use ```^â”€â”€â”€â”€``` to avoid lists of one element and just write its singular dependency as is.
  
### Variables
Variables are referred to by name and their De Bruijn index in their context / local lambdas (Pi, Sigma, etc). 
  
E.g.
```
Î“â‚€ ,Ì£ "x" êž‰ â„• ,Ì£ "y" êž‰ â„• âŠ¢ "y" #0 êž‰ â„•
Î“â‚€ ,Ì£ "x" êž‰ â„• ,Ì£ "y" êž‰ â„• âŠ¢ "x" #1 êž‰ â„•
```
  
Agda will alert when the variable name does not match the index. For example this code:
```
Î“â‚€ ,Ì£ "x" êž‰ â„• ,Ì£ "y" êž‰ â„• âŠ¢ "x" #0 êž‰ â„•
```
will have the following error message:
```
"x" != "y" of type Agda.Builtin.String.String
when checking that the expression "x" #0 has type Exp [ "y" , "x" ]
```

Be aware, they *do* allow overlapping variable names because of this, which Agda will not catch. 
Reusing the same variable name is completely fine in this model, as long as you're referring to actual index you want.

### Rules
Rules make common use of context (env) manipulation, since that needs to be done manually to let Agda track variables. See some rules for examples to pull from like ```â„•-elim```.
